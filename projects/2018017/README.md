### Introduction
Software engineering should be at the forefront of everything that involves computer science concepts for the development and maintenance of dependable software. It is self evident that software development is a very intricate process, especially so in real-world applications that are large and complicated. Thus, in order to produce reliable, efficient and scalable software, the understanding of software engineering concepts and principles **_is required in parallel_** with software development. There is a wide range of fields included in SE, such as lifecycle models, software requirements, validation and verification, development environments, quality assurance design and project management among others.
<br>
The primary focus of this course will be laid on development environments, continuous integration, software automation and performance measurement while other fields may be sequentially covered on a case-by-case basis.<br>
In that regard, some personal pursuits are set:
* Experiment with a different toolchain set (OS, compilers, debuggers etc.)
* Employ the right combination of methodologies, tools and procedures to support safe, reliable and efficient human-centered design in a selected software environment
* Enhance workflow productivity with DE setup automation

### Weekly Video Quizzes
