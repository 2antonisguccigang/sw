### Παραδοτέα

## CV:
The CV website can be found [here](https://runtheorun-exe.github.io/online-cv/) and its repo [here](https://github.com/runtheorun-exe/online-cv).
Currently it is static, and hosted by gh-pages. It is "dressed" by a modified skin provided by the cv [template](https://github.com/sharu725/online-cv) I used. 

[<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/runtheorun-exe/swfiles/main/cv.png" title="click me! i don't bite(much)"  width="400"/>](https://runtheorun-exe.github.io/online-cv)

You can probably see why anything seen here might change in the future. Next steps regarding this assignment would be a PDF conversion and potentially setting up continuous integration? Or just a redesign of the template used. 


## Pull Request #1
You can find all the needed information [here](https://github.com/ioniodi/sitegr/issues/78) but a summary of what happened will follow.
Seeing as I lacked any experience with netlify, .yaml files and almost all other tools used to build our own [Ionian DI](https://epic-hamilton-da9ac8.netlify.app/) website, I chose to perform maybe one of the simplest, self-explanatory tasks available; update the website so it linked to the new [Department President](https://epic-hamilton-da9ac8.netlify.app/people/emagos/).
That's all really. The thought is that for the next PR I will be more comfortable to dive into tougher projects.

## CLI Exercise #1
This one was a hassle and a half.
I chose to work on the [ntfy](https://github.com/dschep/ntfy) assignment. It seemed like the perfect combination of simple and useful. It's worth mentioning that at this point I started this assignment after I had started wokring on the Collaborative Content Assignment, thinking the cli was overdue. Basically I ended up working on two painfully problematic assignments. Back to ntfy.
ntfy offers shell integration and a variety of 3rd party apps one can use to receive notifications on their smartphones et cetera. And generally I believe they could be sorted into two categories: the more straight-forward ones and the less-documented ones (Telegram, and PushBullet respectively). 
I was stubborn enough to push ahead with PushBullet (even though I had been made aware of the fact that Telegram is far more simple). The problem was there seemed to be no clear guidance as to how to tell ntfy the API key I issued from PushBullet. I messed with so many different things settings and files, and 2 virtual boxes and a subsystem ended up being nerfed because I was never able to perform a fresh install of ntfy (and reset the files I had screwed up trying to connect to PushBullet). 
Days later, this cutie appeared:

Later, after some bashrc magic (aka shell integration for ntfy by appending "$(ntfy shell-integration)" to the .bashrc file) we can be notified when a long-running task has been completed, as seen here:

<img src="https://github.com/runtheorun-exe/swfiles/blob/main/sudoaptget.gif" width="400"/>

An asciicast documenting the installation process is also available:

<a href="https://asciinema.org/a/403568" target="_blank"><img src="https://asciinema.org/a/403568.svg" width="400"/></a>

## Collaborative Work (pibook) #1
For the first part of the CW assignment, we were asked to cover 2 technologies (upload 2 images for each topic, and write an .md caption for each).
hose to cover 2 related programming languages: [Objective-C](https://runtheorun-pi.netlify.app/gallery/objective-c/) and [Swift](https://runtheorun-pi.netlify.app/gallery/swift-md/). Then after some research I wrote up their captions , found [here](https://github.com/runtheorun-exe/_gallery/blob/master/objective-c.md) and [here](https://github.com/runtheorun-exe/_gallery/blob/master/swift.md). Afterwards, I [updated](https://github.com/runtheorun-exe/site/blob/master/_slides/programming.md) the [Programming Slide Set](https://runtheorun-pi.netlify.app/slides/programming/) and added my contributions to the Timeline. Then I simply deployed my repository with the help of netlify at https://runtheorun-pi.netlify.app/.
The pibook repo utilizes submodules, which while being easy to setup, recording with asciinema made things a whole lot harder. But nevertheless, here is the asciicast which not only shows the submodule installation but also almost the entire workflow for this assignment. Did I mention that almost the entire assignment was completed via terminal? (save for some tweaks and image reuploads).

Not a tough one, but definitely a time-intensive one.

## CV part 2
For the second part of the CV assignment we were tasked to convert our cv into a pdf, which was a pretty straight forward task done with pandoc and the following command:

```
pandoc https://runtheorun-exe.github.io/online-cv/ -f html-native_divs -o cv.pdf --pdf-engine=xelatex
```
This resulted in an (objectively, aesthetically displeasing) [file](https://github.com/runtheorun-exe/online-cv/blob/gh-pages/cv.pdf) which can be seen below
<img src="https://github.com/runtheorun-exe/swfiles/blob/main/Screenshot 2021-04-26 153001.png" width="400"/>

The automation part of this assignment was done with a GitHub Action documented [here](https://github.com/runtheorun-exe/online-cv/blob/gh-pages/.github/workflows/cv2pdf.yml). 
Since the CV has a GitHub Pages-poewred website, the GH Action gets triggered everytime GH Pages has fnished rebuilding the website. This can lead to unnecessary triggers (for instance CSS modifications don't affect the pdf) but seeing as gh Pages needs some time to build the updated website, this solution seemed the best one.


## CLI Exercise #2
For the 2nd CLI Assignment, I chose to work on Huginn. Following the simple installation on Docker, and following [this tutorial](https://github.com/courses-ionio/sw-lab#huginn-agents) I created one website agent and one post agent, the former scraping news from the Ionian University website and the latter pushing them to a channel on slack. Later I added 2 RSS Agents for ThePressProject and CNN Europe. All run every 5 minutes and the Post Agent gets triggered automatically when fresh news are uploaded.

[<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/runtheorun-exe/swfiles/main/Screenshot%202021-04-26%20182535.png" width="400"/>](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/runtheorun-exe/swfiles/main/Screenshot%202021-04-26%20182535.png)

This may or may not be impoved in the near future to create an Agent to notify me about my age group's vaccinations.

## CLI Exercise #3
This time, I chose the twilio assignment. As vague as can be, the goal to "deploy an application that forwards a call depending on a white- and black- list of phone numbers" proved to be a tough one. That's on me and my app hosting choices though, but admittedly the twillio documentation is lacking to say the very very best of it.
Jumping through hoops I made a simple SMS webhook which replies with a link to my resume on any message. 

[<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/runtheorun-exe/swfiles/main/twilio.png" width="400"/>](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/runtheorun-exe/swfiles/main/twilio.png)

This is what someone sees when they text my twilio number.
The code is hosted as a Lambda function on AWS (sue me) which itself is nothing more than a function which has 1 line of code: 
return ' <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>'\
           '<Response><Message><Body>Hello from Theocharis Panagiotis Charalampidis. \nCheck out my resume at https:// (#runtheorun-exe.github.io/online-cv ! </Body></Message></Response>'
           
So basically it just returns a TwiML (Twilio Markup Language) string to the Twilio API that handles the incoming message. The Lambda communicates with Twilio through an API constructed specifically for that.
While on principle, handling a phone tree system is simple, Lambdas are dumb when it comes to Python packages and it's all just a hassle. The upshot of using Lambdas though is that it's theoretically easier to host such Twilio apps.
A Call routing was constructed using Twilio Studio, a Scratch-like environment and it works just fine, but is not pure code and can be seen below.
